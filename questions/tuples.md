# Tuples and records

# Q1: Implement the functions frst, scnd and thrd for tuples with three items.

```haskell
-- TODO
```

# Q2: The function `frst` has been given below. How does it differ from the builtin function `fst`?

```haskell
frst :: (a, b, c) -> a
frst (a, _ , _) = a

-- A) `fst` works on all tuples; frst only works with triplets
-- B) `fst` only works on tuples with two elements and `frst` works with triplets (Y)
-- C) They are the same
```

# Q3: Select the relevant differences between a tuple of n elements and a list of length n elements.

```haskell
-- A) Tuples can contain elements of different types.
-- B) -- INSERT MORE --
```
